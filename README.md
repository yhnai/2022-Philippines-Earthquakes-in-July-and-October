The three zip files contain the downsampled interferograms, slip models and Coulomb stress distribution of the Philippines earthquakes in July and October 2022. 

Dataset S1 provides coseismic interferograms of the July Abra earthquake and October 2022 Abra earthquake from Sentinel-1. Note that the downsampled interferograms are stored in ASCII text format, and each text file contains seven columns representing: “longitude, latitude, LOS-displacement, E-vector, N-vector, U-vector, sacle-factor”. 

Dataset S2 provides coseismic slip distribution models. Note that the coseismic slip distribution were stored in ".simp" format, with each little fault patch recorded as one row, each row containing ten elements, "lon(deg) lat(deg) str(deg) dip(deg) dep(km) wid(km) leng(km) s_slip(m) d_slip(m) o_slip(m) ". 

Dataset S3 provides the Coulomb stress distribution results generated by earthquakes in July and October, as well as the results of earthquakes in July on the fault plane of earthquakes in October.
